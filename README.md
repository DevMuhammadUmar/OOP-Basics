# OOP Basics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ organizes code into reusable classes that act as blueprints for objects. Its four core principles are encapsulation (bundling data and methods with controlled access), abstraction (hiding complex details), inheritance (deriving new classes from existing ones), and polymorphism (allowing objects to behave differently in different contexts). These concepts enable modular, maintainable, and scalable code by modeling real-world relationships and reducing redundancy, making complex systems easier to manage and extend.
